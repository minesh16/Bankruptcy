    "### Background\n",
    "The __Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA)__ is responsible for regulating the personal insolvency and personal property securities regimes. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is bankruptcy? (Source - AFSA Website)\n",
    "Bankruptcy is a legal process where you're declared unable to pay your debts. It can release you from most debts, provide relief and allow you to make a fresh start.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can enter into voluntary bankruptcy. We refer to this as a debtor's petition. It's also possible that someone you owe money to (a creditor) can make you bankrupt through a court process. We refer to this as a creditor's petition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bankruptcy normally lasts for 3 years and 1 day.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bankruptcy trustee\n",
    "When you become bankrupt we appoint a trustee. A trustee is a person or body who manages your bankruptcy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can either be the Official Trustee (AFSA) or a registered trustee. You can also nominate a registered trustee of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debtors Obligations\n",
    "When you are bankrupt:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - you must provide details of your debts, income and assets to your trustee.\n",
    "> - your trustee notifies your creditors that you’re bankrupt - this prevents most creditors from contacting you about your debt.\n",
    "> - your trustee can sell certain assets to help pay your debts.\n",
    "> - you may need to make compulsory payments if your income exceeds a set amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal insolvencies include bankruptcies, debt agreements and personal insolvency agreements. We have provided data on personal insolvencies for calendar years 2007 to 2018. Data for 2007 are from 1 July 2007, and data for 2018 are to 30 June 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you enter into a personal insolvency, you must complete a statement of affairs. That form asks for a range of information, including your income, debts and assets. We have provided debtors’ responses from this form. We have published this information as the debtor initially reported it, irrespective of subsequent checks and revisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "More information about the dataset can be obtained by visiting the link below:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Bankruptcy Challenge Dataset](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/attributes-of-insolvent-debtors)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement from AFSA\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. __Validate Income and Assets declared by Debtors:__ \n",
    "       When people go through personal insolvency, it could be very stressful time for them. When they complete the statement of affairs they might forget to include certain details e.g. other sources of income, all assets, etc. AFSA wants to understand how we can predict the debtors income and assets using social, employment and other insolvency related information provided by debtors. \n",
    "> 2. __Using Debtors information predict Income and Assets over 3 year period:__\n",
    "       When people file for bankruptcy they are usually bankrupt for 3 years so AFSA wants to understand when their circumstances might change. Or within limits, AFSA might be able to sell their assets to repay their creditors. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "John is 44, a builder and is currently not working because of health problems. If he was bankrupt, how would AFSA tell if he gave AFSA accurate data when he declared bankruptcy and whether his circumstances will change over the next 3 years e.g. getting another job, buying houses or shares etc?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hack\n",
    "\n",
    "As a part of this hackathon, we will fundamentally focus on Problem statement 1. We will use AFSA dataset to build a __Machine Learning model__ to predict debtors' income category based on other socio-economic attributes described in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "This document goes through following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __1. Importing Dataset and Relevant Python Libraries__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __2. Data Cleansing and Exploratory Data Analysis__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __3. Feature Engineering__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __4. Predictive Model Building__\n",

    "## 4. Predictive Model Building\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various methods of building machine learning models to predict data. As AFSA had mentioned that people are stressed when declaring for banktrupcy and may not always give us correct or complete information. Hence we believe the do believe that data accuracy and data quality may be an issue. As a result we will be using __Ensemble Adaptive Boosting and Random Forest Classification__ techniques to build train our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is an ensemble method?\n",
    "Ensemble is a Machine Learning concept in which the idea is to train multiple models using the same learning algorithm. The ensembles take part in a bigger group of methods, called multiclassifiers, where a set of hundreds or thousands of learners with a common objective are fused together to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second group of multiclassifiers contain the hybrid methods. They use a set of learners too, but they can be trained using different learning techniques. Stacking is the most well-known. If you want to learn more about Stacking, you can read my previous post, “Dream team combining classifiers“.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main causes of error in learning are due to noise, bias and variance. Ensemble helps to minimize these factors. These methods are designed to improve the stability and the accuracy of Machine Learning algorithms. Combinations of multiple classifiers decrease variance, especially in the case of unstable classifiers, and may produce a more reliable classification than a single classifier.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What is Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is a method of converting a set of weak learners into strong learners. Suppose we have a binary classification task. A weak learner has an error rate that is slightly lesser than 0.5 in classifying the object, i.e the weak learner is slightly better than deciding from a coin toss. A strong learner has an error rate closer to 0. To convert a weak learner into strong learner, we take a family of weak learners, combine them and vote. This turns this family of weak learners into strong learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AdaBoost(Adaptive Boosting):\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adaptive Boosting technique was formulated by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire, who won the Gödel Prize for their work. AdaBoost works on improving the areas where the base learner fails. The base learner is a machine learning algorithm which is a weak learner and upon which the boosting method is applied to turn it into a strong learner. Any machine learning algorithm that accept weights on training data can be used as a base learner. In the example taken below, Decision stumps are used as the base learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the training data and randomly sample points from this data and apply decision stump algorithm to classify the points. After classifying the sampled points we fit the decision tree stump to the complete training data. This process iteratively happens until the complete training data fits without any error or until a specified maximum number of estimators.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is Bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap Aggregation (or Bagging for short), is a simple and very powerful ensemble method. Bagging is the application of the Bootstrap procedure to a high-variance machine learning algorithm, typically decision trees. Suppose there are N observations and M features. A sample from observation is selected randomly with replacement(Bootstrapping). A subset of features are selected to create a model with sample of observations and subset of features. Feature from the subset is selected which gives the best split on the training data. This is repeated to create many models and every model is trained in parallel\n",
    "Prediction is given based on the aggregation of predictions from all the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "[More information on Bagging](https://becominghuman.ai/ensemble-learning-bagging-and-boosting-d20f38be9b1e)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest Classification:\n",
    "Random forest is an ensemble model using bagging as the ensemble method and decision tree as the individual model. Random forest, like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our model’s prediction.\n",
